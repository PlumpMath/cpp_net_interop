"DotNetZip is a FAST, FREE class library and toolset for manipulating zip files." (official website)

Not everything from this library can be used in bridge, please choose carefully!
Simple methods (like ZipFile constructor, AddFile method, etc.) works perfectly.

`client.cpp` is a very simple example of using generated bridge. 
It's purpose is to create a zip file called "out.zip" containing a file "client.cpp".

You need to generate and compile a bridge with at least following methods: 
  ZipFile(), AddFile(String fileName), Save(String fileName)
