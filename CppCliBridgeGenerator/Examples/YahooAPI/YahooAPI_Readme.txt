"YahooAPI" is an example library created originally for testing methods of interop
between native and managed code. It uses public Yahoo Finance API for getting
informations about stocks.


It is fully usable in generator as it is (you can check everything and press Generate).


`client.cpp` is an example of using generated bridge.
