"DotNetZip is a FAST, FREE class library and toolset for manipulating zip files." (official website)

You should be able to generate and compile bridge for everything in this library.

Official website of library: http://dotnetzip.codeplex.com/




`client.cpp` is a very simple example of using generated bridge. 
Its purpose is to create a zip file called "out.zip" containing a file "client.cpp".

You need to generate and compile a bridge with at least following methods: 
  ZipFile(), AddFile(String fileName), Save(String fileName)
